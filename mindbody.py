"""Mind & Body: yoga poses, Baduanjin qigong and cool-down picks, as cards in the same shape as the
exercise library (api.library_card). Written for Joe's constraints: left kidney pyeloplasty adhesions
(no deep twists, deep backbends, compression or inversion-type loading in automatic picks) and a
hypertonic pelvic floor (nothing that makes him grip or bear down; long slow exhales).
